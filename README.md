# Black-Friday-EDA-and-feature-engineering

The Black Friday EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and feature engineering process involve examining and understanding the data related to Black Friday sales and customer behavior. It aims to extract meaningful insights and create informative features that can enhance predictive models or provide valuable information for decision-making.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Understanding: Analyze the structure and content of the Black Friday dataset, including the available variables, their types, and their distributions.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure the data quality.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, and variance, to gain initial insights into the data.
Univariate Analysis: Examine individual variables to understand their distributions, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables, such as correlation analysis or cross-tabulations, to identify potential associations or dependencies.
Feature Engineering:

Variable Transformation: Transform variables using mathematical operations, such as logarithmic or power transformations, to normalize their distributions and reduce skewness.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms.
Feature Creation: Derive new features from existing variables, such as calculating ratios, aggregating information, or extracting temporal or spatial features.
Feature Scaling: Normalize numerical features to a common scale, such as using standardization or min-max scaling, to avoid dominance by variables with larger magnitudes.
Handling Date and Time: Extract meaningful information from date and time variables, such as day of the week, month, or time of day, to capture temporal patterns.
Handling Text Data: Process and analyze text-based variables, such as customer reviews or product descriptions, using techniques like text tokenization, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling.
Feature Selection:

Statistical Techniques: Employ statistical tests, such as chi-square or ANOVA, to evaluate the relationship between features and the target variable and select the most informative ones.
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or feature importance ranking, to reduce the number of features while retaining relevant information.
By performing EDA and feature engineering on the Black Friday dataset, analysts and data scientists can uncover hidden patterns, understand customer preferences, and create informative features that contribute to building accurate predictive models or making data-driven business decisions.
